This map shows the locations of 30 major shipwrecks off the coast of Western Australia. According to the Cosmos article "Good and badâ€”the news on climate change and shipwrecks," climate change has led to an increased risk of shipwreck deterioration due to factors such as sea level rise, high temperatures, salinity, and pH. Using the Western Australian Museum's Shipwreck Database and Climate Change in Australia's Marine Explorer, I have assigned risk values to each major shipwreck. These values were determined based on an RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) of 8.5, which predicts a scenario in which emissions continue to rise over the next decade. 

Users can pan, zoom, and click on each tooltip to view popup information about each shipwreck. This information includes ship name, date lost, location found, and a link to more information. A container includes information about this issue, as well as a link to Cosmos article. This map was created using Leaflet CSS and JavaScript libraries, as well as Chroma, Ajax, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts.
